## Project Overview
We started this school project as a way for us to familiarize and improve our skills in using new technologies: 
- [Figma Link :art:](https://www.figma.com/file/DdMZhIVqv59MYfNoGr7Bwx/Trash-Queen-%E2%80%93-FSWD?node-id=0%3A1&t=EuNrSVJUbOSr1EAk-1)
- Built with **Vue.js** and **railway**

## Challenges
Throughout the whole project, we were faced with a multitude of challenges:
- Creating all assets from scratch
- Designing the frames and planning the user flow
- Time constraint of under one week to build the app

## Instructions
### How to run the app:
1. Install dependencies needed to run the project

```sh
npm install
```
2. Run the Dev Project

```sh
npm run dev
```

### How to play(screenshots/screen record):

1. Press quick play to enter easy mode or select “The Game” to change to hard mode
2. Drag the item into the correct recycling bin to gain a point. **If the bin in incorrect, the environment in the back will slowly deteriorate and a trash mountain will appear**
3. Get as many correct while the timer counts down. **If you get 9 wrong, the game will end**
